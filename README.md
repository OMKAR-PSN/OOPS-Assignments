# OOPS Extra Code â€“ C++ Programs

This repository contains extra C++ programs based on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts. It is intended to supplement classroom learning and help with better understanding of C++ topics.

## ðŸ“Œ About

These codes are written as part of my learning in the **Object-Oriented Programming** course during my B.Tech AIML program. They cover key topics such as:

- Classes and Objects
- Constructors and Destructors
- Inheritance (single, multiple, multilevel, hierarchical, hybrid)
- Polymorphism (compile-time and run-time)
- File handling
- Operator overloading
- Templates and exception handling

## ðŸ§  Purpose

This repository was created:
- To keep all my extra practice codes in one place
- To revise concepts during exams
- To help others who are also learning C++

## ðŸ›  How to Run

1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., g++).
2. Clone or download the repository.
3. Compile the desired `.cpp` file:
   ```bash
   g++ filename.cpp -o output
   ./output
